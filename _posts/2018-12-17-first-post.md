This first post is dedicated to showing that I have done some sorta interesting things. I have evidence from the internet. I was interviewed by University of Delaware's College of Agriculture for my undergraduate research [_(interview)_](https://canr.udel.edu/blog/ud-undergraduate-felix-ackon-studies-statistics-markov-chains/). I performed in a play for the Delaware African Student Association during my sophomore year [_(link to great acting)_](https://youtu.be/qCbCt_dbSTU?t=406). I studied abroad in Japan for a month and attempted to write a weekly blog, but, I failed after the first week [_(link)_](https://sites.udel.edu/globalblog/2017/01/getting-to-know-japan/). I will add more as they come but hopefully this is a start to getting to know me.
