This is my first post! I thought it would be good to share some stuff about me that I found on the internet. I was interviewed by University of Delaware's College of Agriculture for my undergraduate research [_(interview)_](https://canr.udel.edu/blog/ud-undergraduate-felix-ackon-studies-statistics-markov-chains/). I performed in a play for the Delaware African Student Association during my sophomore year [_(link to great acting)_](https://youtu.be/qCbCt_dbSTU?t=406). I will add more as they come but hopefully this is a start to getting to know me.
