I am a first year PhD student in Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. I enjoy reading scientific articles along with global news. I am also think I am hilarious so if you read the blog and laugh please let me know. Lastly, I am trying out Capoeira and I'm enjoiying it so far.

**One of my favorite quotes**
