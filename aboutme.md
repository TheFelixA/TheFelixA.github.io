I am currently a first year PhD in the Operations Research and 
Financial Engineering (ORFE) at Princeton University. Prior to that I was a 
Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. I love to 
laugh so I'm hoping I can translate some of that humor into my blog 
posts and then eventually stand up. Lastly, I dabble in Capoeira and 
am trying to learn Spanish.

**One of my favorite quotes**
>"If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done"
