# Mathematician
I recently finished my PhD in Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE) at Princeton University. My research focused on developing innovative models and designing policy mechanisms to manage and mitigate the reliability risks associated with fluctuating supplies of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. My research bridges theory with practice by combining game theoretic and optimization models with empirical market data to conduct counterfactual simulations that will help understand how different market structures and incentive schemes can impact the stability and efficiency of the electric grid.

Despite the complexity of the subject matter, I am fortunate to be pursuing a field in such an essential and dynamic area as a Quantitative Analyst at ExxonMobil Global Trading. Every day brings new insights and discoveries, and I am constantly inspired by the potential for my research to make a real-world impact.

# Hobbies
In my leisure time, I look for inspiration to stay ingenious and creative. I am an amatuer **[photographer](https://thefelixa.github.io/photos/)** who enjoys shooting sports, landscapes and portraitures. I am an amatuer **[comic](https://thefelixa.github.io/comedy/)** that believes that humuor is the best way to connect with people. I also enjoy **[running](https://thefelixa.github.io/run/)** medium distances to stay in shape.
