My name is Felix Ackon. I am a **Blue Hen** (_UDelaware 2017_), **Researcher Associate** (_Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond_) and **Problem Solver**. I enjoy travelling, programming and reading. My interests vary year by year because I enjoy learning and trying out new things.

**One of my favorite quotes**
>"If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done"
