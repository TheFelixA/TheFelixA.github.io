My name is Felix Ackon. I am a Blue Hen (UDelaware), Researcher and Problem Solver. My interests vary year by year so I'm very open to learning and trying out the interests of others.


### One of my favorite quotes 

"If you want something you've never had
You must be willing to do something you've never done"
