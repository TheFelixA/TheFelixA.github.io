#Mathematician
I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE) at Princeton University. My research focuses on developing innovative models anddesigning policy mechanisms to manage and mitigate the reliability risks associated with fluctuating supplies of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. I spend countless hours analyzing data, building mathematical models, and conducting simulations to understand how different market structures and incentive schemes can impact the stability and efficiency of the electric grid.

Despite the complexity of the subject matter, I feel fortunate to be pursuing a career in such an important and dynamic area. Every day brings new insights and discoveries, and I am constantly inspired by the potential for my research to make a real-world impact on the way we generate and distribute electricity.

#Hobbies
In my leisure time, I look for inspiration to stay ingenious and creative. I am an amatuer **[photographer](https://thefelixa.github.io/photos/)** who enjoys shooting sports, landscapes and portraitures. I am an amatuer **[comic](https://thefelixa.github.io/comedy/)** that believes that humuor is the best way to connect with people. I also enjoy **[running](https://thefelixa.github.io/run/)** medium distances to stay in shape.
